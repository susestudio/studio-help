# Xen

These howtos relate to Xen DomU appliances built with SUSE Studio.
Some if not all of these changes can be made automatically by scripting
them.
To boot a DomU Xen guest, you need to have a running Xen
hypervisor with a priviledged Dom0 Xen appliance booted.
Note that Virtual Machine images built in SUSE Studio do NOT include a
swap space. It is common practice to leave swap management to the
hypervisor.

## How to start a Xen guest

Every DomU Xen guest created in Studio comes as a .tar.gz package that needs
to be unpacked to start the guest. The archive includes
a directory containing two files:

    Appliance_name-Version
    |---Appliance_name.architecture-version.raw
    |---Appliance_name.architecture-version.xenconfig

The `.raw` file is the disk image and can be left untouched. The
.xenconfig file contains the configuration for starting the guest and needs to be edited. Its
content looks like this:

    #  -*- mode: python; -*-
    name="kde3.xen"
    memory=512
    disk=[ "tap:aio:Appliance_name.architecture-version,xvda,w" ]
    vif=[ "bridge=xenbr0" ]

In order to boot the guest, it is necessary to edit some of these
options, depending on the setup of Dom0. Basically you only need to adapt
the 'disk' entry in order for Xen to actually find your disk image.
Another option that might need editing is 'vif' in environments where no
bridged networking is used or the bridge has a different name than
xenbr0. A detailed description of the options in the config file and which
might need changing follows below.

**WARNING**

In many xen documentations the command "xm console" or the option "-c"
with the "create" command are mentioned to give you access to the
xenconsole. However with some recent images, the console output is
redirected, away from the xenconsole, which might appear 
like the boot process has stalled. This is not the case. For SLE products the
following information should help getting the system running:

The boot process does in fact continue but will stop for SLE products at
the license agreement, which requires confirmation but is not displayed on the
xen console. You need to access the system with either a vncviewer or
virt-viewer during first boot to accept the license. Once the license has been accepted, the
boot process continues and finishes with a login prompt on the xenconsole. This workaround is only neccesarry for
SLE products during first boot. See later sections for directions on how
to access the guest using vnc.

In case you can only access the guest via the xen console during first
boot, you need to add snippet "xencons=tty" to the grub kernel
command. This will prevent a vnc login but will show all boot
output including the license agreement dialogue in the xenconsole. During the
next boot, you do not need repeat this. The login prompt will appear in the xenconsole after the system has been booted.

## How to change Xen guest to Citrix xva

Xen appliances built with SUSE Studio can also be used with Citrix.

The following steps illustrate how to change Xen guest to Citrix xva.

Get xva.py

    wget -c http://www.xen.org/files/xva/xva.py
    chmod +x xva.py
    mv xva.py /usr/local/bin/

Download Build Xen Image in SUSE Studio

    tar -xvf Xen_Image.i686-0.0.1.xen.tar.gz
    cd Xen_Image-0.0.1/
    xva.py -n Xen_Image-0.0.1 --is-pv --disk=Xen_Image.i686-0.0.1.raw --filename=Xen_Image-0.0.1.xva

Import Xen_Image-0.0.1.xva to Citrix XenServer

For more details, refer to [xva README][xva-readme].


## Xen configuration options

Basically you only need to adapt the 'disk' entry for xen to
find your disk image. Another line that might need editng is
'vif' in environments where no bridged networking is used or the bridge
has a different name than xenbr0. Here is an overview of the keywords
in the config file and which might need changing:

**name**

* Specifies with which name the appliance will appear in Xen management
  tools like xm.
* The guest will start without changes.


**memory**

* Defines how much memory in Megabyte will be assigned to the guest.  
* The guest will start without changes made here.


**disk**

* Defines where the disk image containing the guest is located,
  what kind it is and how it will appear inside the guest, and if
  access is read only or read/write.
* You must edit this option to be able to start the guest.

As Xen does not understand relative paths in its config file, you need
to adapt the location in your configuration according to the location of
the disk image. If you unpacked the guest tar.gz file in /opt/guests,
the disk image is located in
/opt/guests/Appliance_name-Version/. To be able to boot the guest, change the disk entry
from

    disk=[ "tap:aio:Appliance_name.architecture-versionraw,xvda,w" ]

to

    disk=[ "tap:aio:/opt/guests/Appliance_name-Version/Appliance_name.architecture-version.raw,xvda,w" ]


**network**

Determine how the guest will have access to the
host's network, using the keyword vif.
There are several possible settings and explaining them all would
exceed the scope of this document. In general, the default value
should work with correctly configured Xen Dom0s that use the default
name for the bridge guests can connect to. The guest will start without
this item being changed, but it not have network
connectivity due to a different bridge name in the Dom0 or a
different method of making networking available to guests.

Read [How to configure networking for a Xen guest][xen-config]
for more details on Xen bridged networking.


## How to configure networking for a Xen guest

### Using Xen tools

For a Xen guest to access the network, the privileged Dom0, which has
actual access to the network hardware in the machine, needs to be
prepared.

* Run `/etc/xen/scripts/network-bridge`

This will configure a bridge 'xenbr0' and connect it with the ethernet
interface of the machine.


### Manually configuration

* Disable any specific configuration for your ethernet interface by
  removing its config file in /etc/sysconfig/network.
* Create config file `/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-xenbr0` for the
  bridge xenbr0 with the following content:


        BOOTPROTO='dhcp'
        BRIDGE='yes'
        BRIDGE_FORWARDDELAY='0'
        BRIDGE_PORTS='eth0'
        BRIDGE_STP='off'
        BROADCAST=
        ETHTOOL_OPTIONS=
        IPADDR=
        MTU=
        NETMASK=
        NETWORK=
        REMOTE_IPADDR=
        STARTMODE='onboot'
        USERCONTROL='no'

* restart your network by running
`/etc/init.d/network restart`

Run `ip addr`. If everything works as expected, you should see an
interface xenbr0, with the host's IP address assigned, while eth0 no
longer has an IP address. Ping another host in the network to make sure everything
works.


## How to log in to a Xen guest graphically

* As a DomU Xen guest does not have access to a graphic card, it is not
  possible to start X directly on the guest. As a result, the startup
  scripts for X-related settings, which run at boot, fail.
* Working ways to use graphical applications are:

1. [use ssh with X forwarding and start x application from ssh session][oo-ssh-x]
2. [configure xdm for remote access only][oo-xdm-config]
3. [start a vncserver and access it from remote with a vncviewer][oo-vncserver]
4. [make a second graphic card available to DomU via pci][oo-2ndGCard]

### Use ssh with X forwarding and start x application from ssh session

**Requirements**

* The sshd has to be started inside the appliance.
* The ssh port needs to be open in the firewall.

**X forwarding with ssh**

* To use X forwarding with ssh, you need the option -X:

       ssh -X <username>@<hostname|ip adress of DomU>

* Once logged in, you should be able to launch any X-based application
  and get its graphical output forwarded to the machine your ssh client
  is running on.


### Configure xdm for remote access only

---

**WARNING**

Using remote xdm to access your DomU's desktop is a security risk as by
default all traffic is unencrypted, even the username and password during
login. Use this method only in local networks you trust !!!WARNING!!!

---

**On DomU**

* Turn off the firewall (the correct approach would be to open the right
  ports, but describing this here would exceed the scope of this
  document).
* Change in `/etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config`:
       DisplayManager.requestPort:    0
  to
       !DisplayManager.requestPort:    0

* Change in /etc/sysconfig/displaymanager:
       DISPLAYMANAGER_STARTS_XSERVER="yes"
  to
       DISPLAYMANAGER_STARTS_XSERVER="no"

* Run SuSEconfig.
* Restart `xdm`.


**On Dom0 or another host**

* Start X in an existing X session:

      Xnest :1 -query <Hostname/IP of DomU>

* Start X native

       X :1 -query <Hostname/IP of DomU>

This setup has been successfully tested with xdm and kdm.


### Start a vncserver and access it from remote with a vncviewer

* With latest images built in SUSE Studio this is already configured for
  xen guests. For older images you need to add the following line to the
  xenconfig file used to add/create a guest:

       vfb = ["type=vnc,vncunused=1,vnclisten=0.0.0.0"]

* To access the guest, you can either run (0 is the port used for the
  first guest being started, others then simply increase the port by
  one)

       vncviewer :0

  or

       virt-viewer <guest name>|<guest ID>

  This will then open a vnc view to the framebufer of the guest.

* If virt-viewer is supposed to be run from a Studio built Dom0 with
  X forwarding, the packages virt-viewer and xorg-x11-fonts-scalable
  need to be added to the appliance before.


### Make a second graphic card available to DomU via pci.
